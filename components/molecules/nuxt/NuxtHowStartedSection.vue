    <template #description>
      SÃ©bastien (@Atinux) made his first commit for Nuxt.js on GitHub on October
      26th 2016. The code base was born after we refactored an e-commerce
      website with modern open source web technologies: Vue 2, Node.js and
      Webpack. At the time, there was no documentation for server-side rendering
      Vue.js applications - we learnt through the Hacker News example published
      by Evan You (Creator of Vue.js).

      [The idea of creating a boilerplate and reusing the code base for other
      projects became clear once we discovered Guillermo Rauch 's introduction
      of Next.js.]{.font-semibold}
