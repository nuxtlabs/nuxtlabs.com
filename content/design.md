DM Sans

The quick brown fox jumps over<br />
the lazy dog.
#description
Our brand typeface is DM Sans by Colophon Foundry for Google. This
open-sourcetypeface was chosen for its combination of smoothness and
structure. Its geometric shapes and soft transitions will bring clarity
and openness to our texts. Also, itâ€™s open availability will let other
members of the NuxtJS community incorporate it into their work.
