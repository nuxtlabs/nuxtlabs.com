The Founders

#content
[Alexandre Chopin](https://twitter.com/iamnuxt) and [Sébastien Chopin](https://twitter.com/atinux) discovered their passion for computers and web development deep within the Pyrenees Mountains [(heritage reflected in the NuxtLabs logo if you haven’t noticed!)]{.text-gray-800}. They taught themselves how to code as kids and designed websites at night, weekends and during school holidays.

They worked on their first external project together, creating a browser game website built with PHP, HTML, CSS and jQuery - this fortunately covered part of their college studies! They both had the entrepreneurial bug at this point.

The Company

#content
NuxtLabs is born in 2017 few months after the production release of [NuxtJS](/nuxtjs) and the need of many companies for Nuxt training and consultancy such as Adobe, Accor, BackMarket, Bershka, Lequipe, Sephora, Ubisoft and many others.

In January 2020, NuxtLabs raised $2M (pre-seed) to build a team of Nuxt experts working full time on Open Source and business solutions around it.
