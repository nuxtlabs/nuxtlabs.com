How it started
#contentDescription
[Sébastien (@Atinux) made his first commit for Nuxt.js on GitHub on October
26th 2016. The code base was born after we refactored an e-commerce
website with modern open source web technologies: Vue 2, Node.js and
Webpack. At the time, there was no documentation for server-side rendering
Vue.js applications - we learnt through the Hacker News example published
by Evan You (Creator of Vue.js).]{.block .pb-8 .text-primary-500}

[Once we had created the repository on GitHub to open source our code, we had our first challenge: find a name for our project! We tried couples of names on npm who were already taken. In the end we landed on NUXT which was short and explicit. React & Next made us realize that Vue, Nuxt was a natural fit for us. It is like Next.js but for Vue.js.]{ .text-white .md:w-2/3 }

<!-- ## The Intuitive Vue framework.

Sébastien ([@Atinux](https://twitter.com/Atinux)) made his first commit for Nuxt.js on GitHub on October 26th 2016. The code base was born after we refactored an e-commerce website with modern open source web technologies: Vue 2, Node.js and Webpack. At the time, there was no documentation for server-side rendering Vue.js applications - we learnt through the [Hacker News example](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-hackernews-2.0) published by [Evan You](https://twitter.com/youyuxi) (Creator of Vue.js). The idea of creating a boilerplate and reusing the code base for other projects became clear once we discovered [Guillermo Rauch](https://twitter.com/rauchg)'s [introduction of Next.js](https://vercel.com/blog/next).

### Why the NUXT name?

Once we had created the repository on GitHub to open source our code, we had our first challenge: find a name for our project! We tried couples of names on npm who were already taken. In the end we landed on NUXT which was short and explicit. rEact ⇒ nExt made us realize that vUe ⇒ nUxt was a natural fit for us. It is like Next.js but for Vue.js.

### Performance, Modularity and Developers Happiness

The core mission at Nuxt is to provide frontend developers happiness with an open source framework to build fast and high performing websites and applications based on Vue.js with as little friction as possible. Our credo is "Convention over Configuration" to help solve some of the difficulties involved in Vue.js application development. Automatic vue-router configuration based on file system detection is the first and most popular feature of the framework. With the efforts of our community and contributors around the world, over time our framework became ready for production. Every feature and bug fix since has been made with the sole purpose of improving the performance and experience for all our users.
